COS314 - Assignment 3: Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier (Java)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
------------
This program implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network in Java using the Weka library
to classify whether a stock (cryptocurrency) should be purchased based on historical data
provided in BTC_train.csv and BTC_test.csv.

The program evaluates the model using accuracy and F1 score on both training and testing datasets.

Dependencies:
-------------
You must have the following installed:

- Java 8 or later
- Weka 3.9.6 (weka.jar)
- MTJ (Matrix Toolkit for Java) (mtj.jar)

To compile:
> javac -cp .:weka-3-9-6/weka.jar mlp.java

To run:
> java --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED -cp .:weka-3-9-6/weka.jar:mtj.jar mlp

Files:
------
- mlp.java               --> Java implementation using Weka MultilayerPerceptron
- BTC_train.csv          --> Training dataset (CSV format)
- BTC_test.csv           --> Testing dataset
- weka.jar               --> Weka library
- mtj.jar                --> Required for matrix operations in MLP
- requirements.txt       --> This instructions file

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile and run as shown above.
3. When prompted, enter:
   - Seed value (e.g., 77)
   - Path to training CSV file (e.g., ../data/BTC_train.csv)
   - Path to testing CSV file (e.g., ../data/BTC_test.csv)

Output:
-------
- Accuracy and F1 score on the **training dataset**
- Accuracy and F1 score on the **testing dataset**

Example Output:
---------------
=== MLP Classification Report ===

--- Training Set Performance ---
Accuracy: 0.8912
F1 Score: 0.8945

--- Testing Set Performance ---
Accuracy: 0.7430
F1 Score: 0.7519

Notes:
------
- The last column in the CSV files must be the **class label**.
- The class label must be **binary (e.g., 0 or 1)** and is automatically converted to **nominal** inside the program using Weka filters.
- CSV files must be clean (no missing values) and have numeric input features.
